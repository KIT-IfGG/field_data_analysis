### Vegetation analysis ####
### for the full dataset including classification, 
### ordination and a characterization of vegetation 
### classes using site information

### Deliveral ####
### Upload R-code to Ilias (no emails)
### Use this file, rename it to yourlastname_task.R
### and fill in you r-code for the specific tasks.
### It needs to be executable! 
### Clear workspace and execute, use original data files and
### not files changes by hand, use another computer and execute

### Start ####
### Read and check the data ####

### What to do with rare species? ####

### Classification: apply isopam ####
### Transformation
### Decide on number of classes, write an interpretation
### Why did you choose exactly k classes?

### Create boxplots for each Ellenberg value (e.g. F)
### for differences among your vegetation classes

### Calculate a correponding Kruskal-Wallis rank sum
### test for each case. Why is a ANOVA not appropiate?

### Plot a map with sites and vegetation types ####
### Alternativly you can plot another interesting
### variable using point size!

### Calculate an ordination ####
### Transformation same as for classification?
### Use vegetation classes as point colors/shapes
### Calculate an environmental fit of Ellenberg values and 1 to 3 other
### seemingly relevant sites parameters.
### Plot the fit into the ordination and interprete significances.

### Characterization of vegetation ####
### Provide a description of each vegetation class using
### character species, stand forming "important" species, 
### Ellenberg values and site parameters such as northing.
### Which species do occur together, which are at different
### "ends" of the gradient (use the ordination plot)? Are
### there species groups?
